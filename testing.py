# **Step 0: Data Loading and Initial Cleaning**

data = pd.read_csv("HospitalData.csv", low_memory=False)  # Replace with your file

data.info()
# Handle missing data (adjust techniques as needed)
#data.dropna(subset=['CCS Diagnosis Description', 'Length of Stay', 'Age Group'], inplace=True)  # Assuming these columns are crucial or use imputation techniques 

# **Step 1: Average Time Spent in the Hospital for Each Illness**

# Calculate average length of stay per diagnosis
# average_los_per_diagnosis = data.groupby('CCS Diagnosis Description')['Length of Stay'].mean()

# # Visualize (Optional)
# top_15_avg_los = average_los_per_diagnosis.nlargest(15) 
# top_15_avg_los.plot(kind='barh', title='Top 15 Average Length of Stay by Diagnosis')
# plt.show()

# # **Step 2: Patient Demographics and Effects on Illness Prevalence and Consequences**

# # Analyze age distributions
# sns.histplot(data, x='age', bins=20, kde=True) 
# plt.title('Distribution of Patient Ages')
# plt.show()

# # Explore illness prevalence across different demographics
# for demographic in ['race', 'geography']:  
#     sns.catplot(x='diagnosis', kind='count', hue=demographic, data=data)
#     plt.xticks(rotation=45)
#     plt.show()

# # Examine impact on treatment results
# data.groupby(['diagnosis', 'treatment_outcome'])['length_of_stay'].mean().unstack()

# # Consider statistical tests: ANOVA to analyze differences in length of stay between demographic groups

# # **Step 3: Links Between Treatment Results and Diagnoses**

# # Calculate success rates by diagnosis and treatment 
# treatment_success_rates = data.pivot_table(
#     values='treatment_outcome', index='diagnosis', columns='treatment_treatment_type', aggfunc='mean'
# )

# treatment_success_rates.plot(kind='bar', title='Treatment Success Rates by Diagnosis')
# plt.show()

# # Consider statistical tests: Chi-squared test for independence to analyze the relationship between diagnosis and treatment success.

# # **Step 4: Constraints**

# # Address missing data:
# data.isnull().sum()  # Quantify missingness per column 
# # Use imputation techniques or carefully remove rows/samples
# # For sensitive columns like height/weight/blood type, explain how those would enhance analysis if available.

# # Consider limited dataset size:
# print(data.shape)
